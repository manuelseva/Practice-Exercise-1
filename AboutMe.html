Hi I am Manuel Seva.
My long time dream is to become a Programmer so this bootcamp is my 1st step to achieve  my dream.
Currently I choose to back in study so when I become a real Programmer its more easier to apply in the companies.
I love to spend quality time with my loved ones.
And in my free time I play online games like Dota 2, also I love to play basketball.
